                            <p>
                                I have been working as an undergraduate researcher at Biorobotics Laboratory since 2020 (Advised by Kyujin Cho).
                                I developed a <b>soft robotic wearable system for ankle sprain prevention</b>, where I oversaw the overall development of the system: design, fabrication, and system integration.

                            </p>

                            <!--<div id="indent">
        <p>

            1) <b>Soft material-based</b>: The AFO is mostly made from soft materials to obtain a minimal form factor.
            It applies minimal load to the distal parts of the lower limb for comfort and long term use.
            In order to accomplish this while maximizing the assistance in the ankle INV/EV stiffness, tape structure that is lightweight and has high stiffness is integrated into the pneumatic actuator.

            <br />
            2) <b>Anisotropic stiffness actuator</b>: To maximize the assistance in INV/EV stiffness while minimizing the same effect on DF stiffness,
            tape structure that has high stiffness in the INV/EV direction and low stiffness in the DF direction is introduced.
            <br />
            3) <b>Image-based control</b>: The AFO is controlled based on the real-time images of the ground.
            Based on these images, ground roughness is measured and classified into several levels, and the actuation level is determined accordingly.
            That is, the actuators are regulated based on the walking environment, meaning that the device can provide proper assistance under different circumstances.

        </p>

                            <div style="text-align:center">
                                <span class="image"> <img src="images/APS_1.jpg" height="350" /> </span>

                                The device places <b>Active I/E Support Units</b> on either side of the ankle to increase the INV/EV stiffness of the ankle.
                                <br> The unit has two features;
                                <b>1) anisotropic structural characteristic</b> for enhancing INV/EV stiffness with minimal effect on DF/PF stiffness which allows minimal interference with user’s natural walking,
                                and <b>2) pneumatic-based active engaging mechanism</b> where the level of ankle assistance can be controlled by controlling the pneumatic pressure inside the units.
                            </p>
                            <div style="text-align:center">

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The RGB-D camera mounted on the user’s waist acquires real-time images of the ground and both legs,
                                and the control algorithm determines the ground roughness and the gait phase based on these images.
                                Based on these information, the assistance level of the device is controlled in order to adjust to various walking environments.

                                I am currently working on further experiments with additional subjects for a more rigorous evaluation of the ankle wearable system.
